  "maturity": "Concept",
  "persona": ["Shop Floor", "Engineer"],
  "overview": "The Quality Escapes Prevention Agent uses pattern recognition across process data, inspection results, and historical defect patterns to identify products at elevated risk of quality issues. It alerts quality teams to investigate before products ship, reducing customer-facing defects.",
  "whatItDoes": [
    "Monitors process parameters against quality control limits",
    "Identifies products with elevated defect risk based on patterns",
    "Correlates process deviations with historical quality outcomes",
    "Prioritizes inspection focus on high-risk units",
    "Generates root cause hypotheses for quality investigations"
  ],
  "prompts": [
    "Which units from today's production have elevated risk?",
    "What process parameters correlate with this defect type?",
    "Show me the risk profile for this serial number",
