  "overview": "The Failure Modes & Lessons Learned Agent helps engineers access institutional knowledge about past failures, root causes, and corrective actions. It surfaces relevant historical issues during design reviews and helps ensure lessons learned are applied to new designs.",
  "whatItDoes": [
    "Searches failure history databases using natural language",
    "Identifies relevant past failures based on design similarity",
    "Surfaces lessons learned during design review preparation",
    "Links failure modes to design recommendations",
    "Tracks closure of lessons-learned actions on new programs"
  ],
  "prompts": [
    "What failures have we seen with similar turbo bearing designs?",
    "Surface lessons learned relevant to this aftertreatment design",
    "What root causes have been identified for fuel injector failures?",
    "Which design changes addressed the 2022 X15 oil leak issue?",
    "Show me failure modes to review for high-pressure fuel systems"
