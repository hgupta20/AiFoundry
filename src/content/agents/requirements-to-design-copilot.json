  "overview": "The Requirements-to-Design Copilot assists engineers in converting customer and regulatory requirements into detailed engineering specifications. It analyzes requirements documents, identifies gaps and conflicts, suggests design parameters, and helps ensure traceability throughout the development process.",
  "whatItDoes": [
    "Parses and structures requirements from multiple sources",
    "Identifies gaps, conflicts, and ambiguities in requirements",
    "Suggests design parameters based on similar past projects",
    "Maps requirements to test cases and validation criteria",
    "Maintains traceability between requirements and design decisions"
  ],
  "prompts": [
    "Analyze these customer requirements and identify any conflicts",
    "What design parameters were used for similar emission requirements?",
    "Generate test criteria for this durability requirement",
    "Flag any requirements that lack clear acceptance criteria",
    "Map these regulatory requirements to our standard design checklist"
